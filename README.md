## Project Overview
###An Automated IP Scanner.
This will be a tool that analyzes IP addresses and determines their security risk level. It pulls data from public blacklists, geolocation databases, and reputation services to produce a risk score and classification (e.g., Safe, Suspicious, Malicious). The goal is to help security teams quickly triage IP addresses during investigations or monitoring.

### Core Features
- Input an IP
- Pull from:
	- Blacklists
	- Geolocation
	- Reputation Scores
- Return: 
	- Risk Score
	- Classification Label 
	- Some information about the IP
	- An explanation on why the IP was flagged

### How AI will be used
- It will help combine the data being pulled and put it into a single risk score.
- Help detect patterns.
- Summarize why the IP was flagged.

### Expected Results
- A working tool that:
	- Accepts an IP address 
	- Queries multiple threat intelligence sources
	- Produces a risk score and classification
	- Generates Ai-assisted explanations
- With the documentation on how we got it to work
